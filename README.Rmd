This tiny "package" presents a tidyverse workflow of 

* renaming/creating factor levels: `melanoma_formatting()`
* including any number of variables in a logistic regression model and formatting the output in a tidy-broom manner: `glm_tidyresult()`
* create a forest plot, including a table with the odds ratios and p-values:
  + a table as a graphical object: `or_table_plot()`
  + a forest plot: `or_plot()`
* a combination function that calls all of the above in order: `or_forest()`
