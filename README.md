This tiny "package" presents a tidyverse workflow of

-   renaming/creating factor levels: `melanoma_formatting()`
-   including any number of variables in a logistic regression model and formatting the output in a tidy-broom manner: `glm_tidyresult()`
-   create a forest plot, including a table with the odds ratios and p-values:
-   a table as a graphical object: `or_table_plot()`
-   a forest plot: `or_plot()`
